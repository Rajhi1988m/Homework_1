# Homework_2 : While Language Interpreter 

Dear instructors, 

I hope you're doing well. In this file, I will explain every step and structure that relates to my first assignment. Moreover, I will provide it with a picture of every action. An important note, this program has written in Python. I used the test case in the file you provide to us, and I wrote more 5 cases as well. 

First: 

When you want to run the program, you will go to directory. This is the command for it : 

1- cd [directory] : cd Homework_while

2- After that you will run either the 'make' or 

 This is the picture of it. 

: make

: make clean "to remove all compile files".

3- When you compile all classes, you will need to run the command : 

./test.sh

So, you can check all cases and make sure that the program work ok. Furthermore, the program test all cases successfully. This is the picture of it. 

Now, I will explain more about the file structure. You can see that the file has four classes, makefile, readme.txt, references.txt, and the file for testing. I will give a short definition of each file. 

1- Task.py, LexerClass.py, ParserClass.py, ASTNodeVisitorClass.py and OperatorNode.py are files or core of the program. 

2- The referenes.txt: Some references help me to finish this assignment. I learn a lot from those resources. Therefore, I list them. 

3- makefile : is the file that compiles all java classes and makes the executable file to run ./test.sh. 

4- readme.txt : I explain in this file how you can run the program and explain some files and structures. 

5- assignment.pdf : this file has pictures of the program 'results'. 

6- The file program_images : You will find a file inside it. This file is called an image. In the image file, I list all the pictures of the program and results. 

This is all about my program. Thank you so much!
